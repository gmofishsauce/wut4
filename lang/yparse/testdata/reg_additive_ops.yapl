// Regression: parseAdditive | and ^ operator output
//
// The parseAdditive function uses a convoluted code path that produces
// correct results "by accident" (yparse-review.md §2). This file is
// used by TestAdditiveOpOutput, which checks that BINARY | and BINARY ^
// nodes appear in the AST output so that a future cleanup of
// parseAdditive cannot silently change its behavior.
