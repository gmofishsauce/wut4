Hi Claude. I removed all the code you wrote for the UART emulator
because I decided it was not on the right track.
The full specifications for the emulated UART
is in the document ../asm/wut4arch.pdf.
In order to simulate a UART, the control terminal of the emulator
does need to be placed in "raw mode" but I don't think the first attempt
at the emulator did this correctly.
Please do not put the emulators control Terminal's file descriptor
into non-blocking mode.
Instead just put the terminal into non-canonical mode
I think this is the right way
to do what I casually think of as "raw mode" on the terminal.
To do this I suggest usin  term.MakeRaw() from "golang.org/x/term".
With the usual protections, like signal handlers,
to make sure the Terminal is placed back in canonical mode
when the process exits.
