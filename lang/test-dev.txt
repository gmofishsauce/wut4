Hi Claude. In this directories you will find a language compiler for a programming language that I designed.
The language is called YAPL.  The compiler was implemented by you it resides in subdirectories and is driven
by the small driver program in "ya/". The compiler generates assembly language targetted at the WUT-4.
The WUT-4 is specified in ../specs/wut4arch.pdf and the assembly language is specified in ../specs/wut4asm.pdf.
The BNF for the language is specified in ./yapl_grammar.ebnf which you helped me write starting from
The informal, non-authoritative description in ../specs/YAPL.pdf. The rest of this repo contains an assembler,
An emulator for the WUT-4 architecture, and some unrelated programs. What I would like you to do is to 
write some software in YAPL.  Obviously it is very similar to the C programming language. I would like you
to start with an itoa() function. Then please write a Fibonacci number program that prints the Fibonacci
numbers in order up to the largest Fibonacci number that will fit in an unsigned 16 bit integer.
You can place this software in the file fib.yapl in this directory. You can place the itoa() in a separate file
called itoa.yapl, also in this directory, and then compile the two files together as required by the YAPL language
which does not have linkable object files. Please think about this and discuss with me before writing the code.
You may access any file in this repo while learning about YAPL.

When you want to run the entire compiler or just run the first few passes but see the intermediate files, you
  should use the ./ya/ya driver and use the –k flag to preserve the intermediate files if you need them rather
  than building your own pipelines. and remember the environment variable YAPL can be used to shorten pads by
  pointing at the root of the compiler tree.
