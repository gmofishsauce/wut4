This is an experiment I tried with handcoding SystemC. I tried this
in cooperation with Google Code Assist. The results were disastrous.
There isn't enough modern, handwritten SystemC around for the AI to
successfully regurgitate code that works.

Status: the code compiles, but immediately dies with a runtime error.
