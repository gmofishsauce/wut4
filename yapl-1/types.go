package main

// This is a language compiler designed to execute in a 64k address space.
//
// This compiler differs from modern compilers in the following way: it is 
// built around a _symbol table_, which contains a unique entry for each
// string symbol or constant value in the program being compiled. Modern
// compilers generally load the entire source file as a string and hold 
// references into the string; in a 64k memory space, this not possible.
//
// The first pass of this compiler makes use of three data structures:
//
// 1) A string table, containing all unique strings stored end to end.
// 2) A symbol table, where each entry may contain either an index into
//    the string table or a literal 16-bit value "lex'd" from the code.
// 3) An abstract syntax tree, where each entry contains a symbol table
//    index and some other information.
// 4) In addition, lexical tokens often contain symbol table indexes.
//
// The compiler makes heavy use of type punning to represent errors.
//
// All indices (into the string table, the symbol table, or the list of
// AST nodes) may be in the range 0 .. 0xBFFF ("48k") only. This is not
// a serious limit given the _entire memory space_ is only 64k, and these
// are indices into arrays, not pointers. Lexical tokens may also encode
// a symbol table index.
//
// All error codes are in the range 0xC000 - 0xFFFF. The end effect is
// that the same set of error codes can be returned by any function that
// normally returns a token, a string table index, a symbol table index,
// or an AST node index. There is one set of error codes and messages
// distinguished values in the low order 12 bits when the high 2 bits
// are 0b11.

// Basic types for self-hosting on the WUT-4. The most basic type is Word.
// A Word can hold a Byte, an Addr, or a Bool. Words, Addrs, and Bytes are
// truthy: nonzero values are Bool "true" and 0 values are Bool "false".
// Arithmetic on Words is unsigned and carries are lost; Bytes are silently
// extended to Words by 0-extension for arithmetic with Words. Arithmetic
// on Bools is not permitted. For now, arithmetic operations on Addrs behave
// as Words; restrictions will be added to address arithmetic as the YAPL
// language evolves.

// These are the only means of input and output, because they are the only
// means implemented in the WUT-4 emulator for eventual self hosting. All
// output from the compiler becomes part of the assembly language result,
// so messages are prefixed with ";" making them assembler comments.

// There are some maximum size constants below. The ultimate max of these
// max sizes is 0xC000 because error codes are the values 0xC000 - 0xFFFF.
// In fact, likely none of these can be greater than 0x8000, if even that, 
// because the tables in this file need to be stored simultaneously in a
// 64k address space during the first pass. The symbol length max, now 15,
// cannot ultimately exceed 255.

// Symbol table entry. Values may be string table offsets in which case
// the length is relevant, or they maybe constant values where the length
// is 0.

// AST nodes use RJ's data oriented tree design. The code knows which
// node types have children. If a node has children, its first child
// node is immediately to its right. Its size is 1 + the size of all
// its children, so the next non-child node is at its index + size.
// It's tempting to try for having the size be a Byte, but I'm afraid
// a Block may have more than 255 Statement-like children. So it goes.

// There are four types of tokens: user defined symbols like
// variable names and constant strings, language defined symbols
// ("keys"), numeric values, and error tokens. The types are
// encoded in the high order 2 bits, leaving 14 bits to be used
// for symbol table index (TT_STR, TT_KEY, and TT_NUM) or actual
// value (TT_ERR). (We cannot in general store constants in the
// token directly because only 14 bits are available, so we must
// create symbol table entries for numerical constants. The value
// of the constant is stored in the symbol table; numeric
// constants do not exist in the strings table.)

// The target machine (WUT-4) doesn't have a barrel shifter, so it's
// helpful to avoid multiple-bit shifts where possible. We don't want
// e.g. (t >> 14) if we can help it, because this will have to compile
// to swap bytes; swap nybbles in low byte; shift right; shift right.
