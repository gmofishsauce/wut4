I would like you to write me an assembler  for the instruction set architecture
described in the local document wut4arch.pdf.
The assembler program should be written in Golang in this directory
so the binary will be called "asm". 
Please also implement a disassembler function accessed by "asm -d wut4-binary-file".
The assembly should produce a binary file that is called wut4.out by default.
The assembler will eventually be self hosted on the WUT-4.
To do this it will be rewritten in a simple programming language of my own design
like a stripped down version of C.
So please use C-like constructs in the Golang code.
Please do not use closures or other constructs that require dynamic memory allocation
and would therefore be difficult to express in C.
Syntax for the assembler is defined in the local document wut4asm.pdf.
The assembly includes a constant expression syntax.
Be sure to separate lexical analysis from parsing correctly here.
The lexer should not know anything about expression syntax.
I recommend implementing a Pratt Parser for constant expresssions
The opcodes are defined in wut4arch.pdf.
I have made a number of recent revisions to this document
which should take priority over previous versions that may be in your context.
