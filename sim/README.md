These are the files that make up the simulator (including generated files).

B - this is the build script. TBD what to do about this.

Sample.c - file of resolver functions, optionally generated by the transpiler

sib.c, sib.h - operations on sibs (4-state simulated bits)

sim - the binary

sim.c, sim.h - the simulator core

TspGen.c, TspGen.h - macros and code generated by the transpiler

util.c, util.h - utilities for the simulator

These won't be here when all is said and done:

tsp - the netlist transpiler
