# sim and tsp - simulator

This is a digital simulator created in part by a transpiler from a KiCad netlist. The transpiler lives in the tsp/ subdirectory.

The other files are:

- api.c, api.h: the API for use by the simulation functions
- Sample.c: functions implementing the components in the simulation
- sim: the simulator
- sim.c, sim.h: the simulator core
- TspGen.c, TspGen.h: these files are generated by the transpiler
- util.c, util.h: a few utilities for I/O.
- B: build script for sim. Does not re-run the transpiler.

## TODO list
### Sooner

 - I/O for the simulator: vcd file generator (target https://github.com/yne/vcd)
 - Put the transpiler in its own repo and rename it
 - 4-value logic functions using LUTs to avoid branches in code
 - Better sample code, separated from simulator core and transpiler
 - Document

### Later

 - Simulators for common 74xxx series components
 - Modify the transpiler to connect component simulators
